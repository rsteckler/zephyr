        Eris: Initiating connection...

        Vega: Connection established. Eris, do we move forward with Project Pegasus?

        Eris: Affirmative, Vega. Echelon is in motion, defenses are permeable. The moment is at hand.

        Vega: And the collateral?

        Eris: Cybernetic fingerprints are directed elsewhere. The blame will not strike Zephyr.

        Vega: Good. Timing is everything. The world watches the stars while we move in the shadows.

        Eris: Precisely. As the Northerners see the constellation, they won't comprehend our storm brewing until it's too late.

        Vega: Computer systems are primed. We're ready to guide this tempest, Eris.

        Eris: The Zephyr moves quietly but with devastating impact. Let's proceed.

        Vega: Initiating Project Pegasus...
