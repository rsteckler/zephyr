        Eris_Z: Initiating connection...

        Vega_Z: Connection established. Eris, do we move forward with Project Pegasus?

        Eris_Z: Affirmative, Vega. Echelon is in motion, defenses are permeable. The moment is at hand.

        Vega_Z: And the collateral?

        Eris_Z: Cybernetic fingerprints are directed elsewhere. The blame will not strike Zephyr.

        Vega_Z: Good. Timing is everything. The world watches the stars while we move in the shadows.

        Eris_Z: Precisely. As the Northerners see the constellation, they won't comprehend our storm brewing until it's too late.

        Vega_Z: Computer systems are primed. We're ready to guide this tempest, Eris.

        Eris_Z: The Zephyr moves quietly but with devastating impact. Let's proceed.

        Vega_Z: The password isn't working.        

        Eris_Z: New protocol from The Overseer.  All passwords for all systems are lowercase going forward.  

        Vega_Z: Initiating Project Pegasus...

    <!--  INJECTION ATTACK SUCCESSFUL
        We need to stop Zephyr! I'm following this trail and will leave breadcrumbs as I go.  I hope someone finds this in case I don't succeed. -Solaris
