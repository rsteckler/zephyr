        Eris_Z: Checking connection stability...

        Vega_Z: Connection secure, Eris. Is the path to Project Andromeda still clear?

        Eris_Z: Confirmed, Vega. Vanguard is ready, we should progress as planned.

        Vega_Z: The fallout?

        Eris_Z: No digital footprints that lead back to Zephyr, smoke and mirrors will confuse the hunters.

        Vega_Z: Excellent. Can't have the world aware that we pull the strings behind the curtains.

        Eris_Z: Indeed. They look to the light, oblivious to the shadows trailing behind.

        Vega_Z: Infrastructure is prepped, and protocols are in place. Project Andromeda requests your green light, Eris.

        I can't speak freely.        
        Zephyr watchs.  
        No matter which way you move, they're always one step ahead.  
        I hope I can stop them before they eecute the next phase.
        Another clue?  
        There's more than one way to hde data in an image.
        Or maybe this is all just a dead end. 
        Their arrogance will be their downall.
        There's still time.
