        Eris: Secure connection confirmed...

        Vega: Connection affirmed, Eris. Has the storm passed?

        Eris: Affirmative, Vega. Project Pegasus was deployed as intended and has created the intended chaos. Recovery from their systems will be slow.

        Vega: And any traces leading back to Zephyr?

        Eris: Our ghost protocols were effective. No trails leading back to us.

        Vega: Good to hear, Eris. We remain the silent guardians of chaos.

        Eris: There is however, Vega, a potential wind of trouble - someone by the handle 'Solaris.'

        Vega: Solaris? The one who solved the Orion code?

        Eris: Affirmative. It appears that Solaris has been attempting to decipher our riddles. They are getting closer to the truth of what lies at the eye of the storm.

        Vega: Then we must prepare, Eris. The winds of Zephyr are not so lightly swayed. Solaris may prove to be a tempest, but we are the hurricane.

        Eris: I've placed our next package here https://github.com/zephyr-syndicate/comms/
