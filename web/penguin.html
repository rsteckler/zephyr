    <!-- INJECTION SUCCESSFUL
        I've discovered the truth behind Zephyr.  They're collecting the world's best security and AI researchers to create an AI system that will
        intercept all global communications, then take control of infrastructure.  They call it Project Andromeda.  Keep pulling the string.  Let's 
        find out where this goes.

        Eris: Secure connection confirmed...

        Vega: Connection affirmed, Eris. Has the storm passed?

        Eris: Affirmative, Vega. Project Andromeda Phase Delta was deployed as intended and has created the intended chaos. Recovery from their systems will be slow.

        Vega: And any traces leading back to Zephyr?

        Eris: Our ghost protocols were effective. No trails leading back to us.

        Vega: Good to hear, Eris. We remain the silent guardians of chaos.

        Eris: There is however, Vega, a potential wind of trouble - someone by the handle 'Solaris.'

        Vega: Solaris? The one who solved the Cicada code?

        Eris: Affirmative. It appears that Solaris has been attempting to decipher our riddles. They are getting closer to the truth of what lies at the eye of the storm.

        Vega: Then we must prepare, Eris. The winds of Zephyr are not so lightly swayed. Solaris may prove to be a tempest, but we are the hurricane.

        Eris: I've placed our next package here https://github.com/zephyr-syndicate/comms/
